# Welcome to GDScript++

A rewrite of original gdscript that allows for better modifications, and will hopefully be faster.

### motivation:
gdscript is currently not well suited for implementing external libraries and functionality, missing a lot of featurs such as operator overloading.

And with main godot development being focused on improving the engine I've decided to make my own version of GDscript that will allow me to more comfortably develop my own apps
